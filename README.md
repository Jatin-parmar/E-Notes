# E-Notes

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to take and manage notes directly in your browser.

## Installation

Due to the $5 requirement for Creating Chrome Store Developer Account & deploying this extension on the Chrome Web Store, I am unable to provide a direct installation link. However, you can still add this extension to your Chrome browser by following these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
3. Toggle on the "Developer mode" switch located at the top-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the cloned/downloaded repository folder.
5. The E-Notes extension will be loaded and available in your Chrome browser.
